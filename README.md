<cite>"You shall not pass!"</cite> - Gandalf

This repository contains a simple boilerplate code to serve as reference material for when I need to have authentication
capabilities in a Flutter app, eg: Login screen, authentication data management.

While developing the initial version I am not focusing on making it secure, but with the next versions, I am looking
forward to making it more secure to be used as reference for production environment code.

The objective is to integrate this app with our authentication microservice https://github.com/macielti/porteiro.
